# The Wyatt S Carpenter Memorial CS3113 Project 4 Test Suite

Hello all. Here is the system I use to test my program.

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FilcLEOxhrr1RxeniRDpEohQOy1KWJtC

(BTW, I intend to delete that folder shortly after the semester is over)

To use, simply place this folder into your project 4 folder, cd into this folder, and run ./test-suite. If you'd like to run a single test, run ./run-test [testname.txt]

If you'd like to compare your test output to the provided output, I recommend using sdiff -b -B [test].out.txt [test].my.txt

The attribution for each script is included as a comment at the top of the script.
