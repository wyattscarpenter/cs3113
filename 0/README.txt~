To solve this programming problem, I essentially used an array of 256 ints, one for each possible byte. As I read bytes from stdin, I incremented the appropriate int. Then, I printed the appropriate characters using printf and for loops.
For this project, I used no references beyond the man pages and the information presented in class.
