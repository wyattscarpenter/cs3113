Project 1

Description
To solve this programming problem, I essentially modified strtokeg.c to cover the custom commands specified in https://oudalab.github.io/cs3113fa18/projects/project1.html. To implement these commands, I used libc wrapper functions.

To Run
Run the executable by itself to run in interactive mode. Pass a batchfile into stdin or as an argument to run the commands in the batchfile.
See https://oudalab.github.io/cs3113fa18/projects/project1.html for list of commands and specification.

Bugs and Assumptions
This project contains no bugs to the best of my knowledge at this time. However, it does contain these assumptions:
Morph and mimic are undefined if [src] is a destination.
Files will not contain spaces and words in comments will not be separated by more than one space.
POSIX-compatible operating system.

References
For this project, I used no references beyond the man pages and the information and materials presented as part of the class. My program is decended from strtokeg.c, as provided in the project 1 specification.
